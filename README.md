# Rest-Practice



### Questions I had while creating this project.

Why does a setter use the void and have variable in ()? Setters used void because its not suppose to return a value. Calling the Variable helps to prevent side effect by validating the value before setting the value to the variable. Taking the parameter and assigning it an attribute.


What does DAO stand for? Data Access Object this is a Structural pattern that allows for isolation of relational database. Keeping the items separate.


Why do we use @AutoWired? We use Autowired for dependency injection


What does the produces parameter do in @getmapping? produces is an optional element that narrows mapping to specific media types produced by mapped handlers.


What is a URI? Stands for Uniform Resource Identifier it is used for identification of a particular resource through a sequence of characters.
